This repository contains reproducible codes for manuscript titled "Discovering Spatial Patterns of Readmission Risk Using a Bayesian Competing Risks Model with Spatially Varying Coefficients". In the manuscript, we described an application on Duke Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, and a simulation study where we used a subset of the EHR data to create the simulated datasets (see the manuscript for details). Because the EHR data contain Protected Health Information (PHI), we cannot share these data.
